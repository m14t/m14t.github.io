                  This was another Symfony based CMS system designed to manage our client's video content.  This site also implmented a Responsive Design to customize the site when viewed from mobile devices.

                  Used Javascipt and HTML5 to build a parallax based animation to celebrate Youtube.com's milestone of receiving more than one hour of uploaded video content every second.  HTML5 animations were created in Flash but converted to use <a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/">Swiffy</a> so they could be rendered in pure javascript.  By pushing the limits of what was possible with Swiffy, we discovered a memory leak in version 3.7.0 and worked with the Swiffy team to fix the issue.

                  Extended Symfony infrastructure traditionally only used by Symfony's command line tool to dynamically create new Objects, Properties, Relations, and forms (with validation, image upload and resizing, and video re-encoding options) which can be used to dynamically create a custom CMS.  This reduced the time to develop the backend of similarly scoped projects from 3 weeks to 3-5 days.
