                        A lightning talk about how to reduce the file size of images by saving the JPG images with large dimensions, but a lower quality, and then down scaling the images in the browser, a technique that allows for more, but smaller artifacts be created in the image, which become imperceptible when scaled. Later versions of this talk included adding other tools to optimize other image formats.
